# AD&D 1E System for Foundry VTT (Unofficial)
All the features you need to play AD&D1E or OSRIC Games in Foundry VTT.

## Installation
I'll work out installation after I've had a chance to fiddle with this some. This is an initial fork from Mes Folies Ludiques, on Gitlab (https://gitlab.com/mesfoliesludiques/foundryvtt-ose)

## License
This Foundry VTT system requires AD&D 1st Edition rules that you can find [here](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse.php?filters=44829_0_0_0_0&src=fid44829)

This third party product is not affiliated with or approved by Wizards of the Coast. \

## Artwork
I will be updating to other artwork as the fork progresses.
Weapon quality icons, and the Treasure chest are from [Rexxard](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/icons/flat-skills-icons-82713).

## Contributions
Any feedback is deeply appreciated. Please issue [tickets](https://github.com/eCyclops/foundryvtt-add1e/issues).
